# Todo list

- [x] create websocket backend that will send data from web/combination_generator.go to the frontend

- [x] create front end for the api [React] {20}. Something simple. Powerball numbers will be parsed and showed in a one column list, and then compared to the random generated numbers in other list.

- [x] clear daily, weekly, monthly, yearly counts every day, week, month, year

- [x] create historical numbers loader

- [x] create routing to historical/Top generated and about page 

- [x] preload top generated numbers page with top generated numbers, add api funtionality for that

- [x] create loader of already generated and dumped numbers

- [ ] Add tabs/pages/dropdown menu to top generated numbers to show top numbers by (by day/week/month/year/all time)

- [*] Use context for requests.

- [ ] Dynamically balance load between number generator and web server, so generator occupies most cpu when web server is idling.  

- [ ] refactor setup logic into separate module. 

- [ ] Add api to return top generated by day/week...

- [ ] Add CD/CI pipeline

- [ ] Handle SIGTERM signal and exit gracefully 

- [x] create pagination component

- [x] integrate pagination into history page

- [x] add api to get history numbers by page

- [x] integrate pagination with top generated numbers page

- [x] highlight PB number everywhere

- [x] Log to files

- [x] Omit static requests in request.log

- [x] Add setting for the logs location and debug/prod variable for gin

- [x] Create parser for new powerball numbers

- [x] Deploy the application (Application was deployed to powerballdata.com, but, unfortunately, mysql doesn't play well with 292MM numbers when it needs to reset every one of them. Need to rethink storage layer and change it to redis/lmdb)


- [ ] add search page ?

- [x] prepare for deployment 

- [ ] create docker container

- [-] setup nginx to route the trafic/handle ssl ?

- [x] gather settings/credentials in one file (db, mail, etc)

- [x] add ssl support 

- [ ] add feedback form

- [*] create tests  

- [x] make generator's seed dynamic.
